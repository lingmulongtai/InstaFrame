PhotoFrameApp

Minimal Android app (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose) that applies a white frame and EXIF captions to selected photos.

How to open:
- Open this folder in Android Studio (recommended) and let it sync Gradle.
- Build and run on a device or emulator (API 24+).

Notes:
- Uses Storage Access Framework to pick multiple images.
- Uses Coil for image loading and ExifInterface for EXIF metadata.
- This is a minimal scaffold. You can improve sampling, error handling, and add save/share/export features.
